# CF969-Big-Data-for-Computational-Finance


This project's goal was to create multiple models for predicting loan defaults based on data from a dataset containing features pertaining to customer loan information. Exploring Linear Regression (LR), Lasso Regression (LaR)[], Ridge Regression (RiR)[11,12], TensorFlow Decision Forest (TF-DF), and a Deep Neural Network (DNN), to identify the best model. The LR, LaR, and RiR models used common linear regression techniques besides a hyperparameter tuning for LaR and RiR, 0.01 to 3 with an increment of 0.01. While TF-DF used TensorFlow and Gridsearch; DNN used a variety of configurations but landed on a 3-3-1 configuration.
